# What Is This?
This is a League of Legends team balancer that synthesizes player data to create the most balanced team matchups by first prioritizing lane match ups then switching members of each lane match-up to create the ideal league game where everyone can have fun against people near their skill level. 
### Personal/Organizational Use:
Email me at [ssovi@berkeley.edu](mailto:ssovi@berkeley.edu) if you would like a copy of the corresponding Google form and Google sheet to use the tool for yourself or your organization.
# HOW TO RUN:
First, run the first code cell to update the data of players

Next, input 10 integers corresponding to the players that will be participating in the match

Then run all cells to output the most balanced pair of teams in a table at the bottom
